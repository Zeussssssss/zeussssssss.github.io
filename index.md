## About Me

I am an incoming Computer Science Ph.D. student at <a href="https://cs.purdue.edu/" rel="noopener"> Purdue University </a>, where I will be advised by <a href="https://cs.purdue.edu/homes/bbenes/" rel="noopener">Dr. Bedrich Benes </a>. My research focuses on computer vision and graphics, and at Purdue, I will be focussing on creating realistic 3D models and simulating natural behaviors. <br> <br>
Previously, I had completed both my Master's and Bachelor's at <a href="https://www.cs.arizona.edu/" rel="noopener">The University of Arizona</a>. During my Master's, I had worked with <a href="https://jalevine.bitbucket.io/" rel="noopener">Dr. Joshua Levine</a> on researching different methods of representing volumetric data. Also, I was a part of the <a href="https://thepaulilab.com/" rel ="noopener">Pauli Lab</a> during my undergraduate years, where I worked as a student developer and researcher, working extensively with plant data captured from different sensors.

Even though I really like this version of my website, the one that I made in my junior year holds a special place in my heart. <a href="old_website/index.html">Click here</a> if you would like to see what it looked like.
